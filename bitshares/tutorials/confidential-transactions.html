<h1>Confidential Transfers<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#confidential-transfers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This tutorial shows how to use the CLI wallet to perform confidential transfers
in BitShares. A confidential transfer is one that hides both the amount being
sent and the parties involved in the trade. Confidential transfers are also
referred to as blinded transfers. When privacy is important no account should
ever be used twice, and coupled with diligent measures to backup and protect the
wallet and document the cryptograhic keys used it is impossible for any third
party to identify how money is moving by using blockchain analysis alone.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the current implementation of Steath
functionality requires careful attention to detail and entails a higher level of
risk for loosing your account balance if the steps followed herein are followed
casually and without regard to such potential loss. However, by following this
guide you can rest assured your balance will be held in the blockchain but
remain totally and completely hidden from everyone but you. With that staunch
admonition out of the way let’s get started.</p>
<p>We will illustrate the CLI commands required to complete every step in this
tutorial. You must be familiar with the witness_node and cli_wallet software to
follow this guide. For further information on how to build and use that software
consult the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-2">readme file</a> on github or the BitShares wiki. I will be using
simple passwords and account names to simplify the presentation. You should
change these to more secure values to provide a higher level of security. Also
note that the CLI wallet echos the command entered which is not reflected in the
quoted session logs in the examples that follow.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-create-a-blind-account">
<h2>Step 1: Create a Blind Account<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#step-1-create-a-blind-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blind Accounts are not registered on the blockchain like the named accounts of
BitShares. Instead a blind account is nothing more than a labeled public key.
The label assigned to the key is only known to your <em>wallet</em>. Thus it is
crucial that you create a new wallet for the blind account and back it up after
completing the balance transfer.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a blind account is to create a new wallet and set a
good quality password for it that would be difficult to crack. Then, using this
wallet we’ll create a labeled account and protect it with a “brainkey”. The
“brainkey” is effectively the private key used by your account. All BitShares
cryptography is based on public / private key pairs, one public which can be
shared the other private known only to you.</p>
<p>For confidential accounts the “brainkey” is only stored in the wallet, so if the
wallet file is lost or destroyed and you have not recorded the “brainkey” on
paper or some other place there will be no way to recover your confidential
account balance. Even if you do record your “brainkey” elsewhere outside of the
wallet, I do not believe any recovery methods yet exist to import your “public
key / brainkey” pair into a wallet so you could access your confidential
balance. At least it would be possible to do so at some future date, unlike the
impossibility it would be if you lost the wallet and failed to record the
“brainkey”.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">create_blind_account</span> <span class="n">alice</span> <span class="s2">&quot;alice-brain-key which is a series of words that are usually very long&quot;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result of the create_blind_account command is to print out the Public Key
associated with the blind account named alice and the command success or failure
(true). Note that the CLI interface will update the wallet file you specified on
the command line following the -w when you started the cli_wallet. The CLI
wallet has no command to quit or exit the interface so we terminate the session
with a control-C (shown as ^C), which returns us to the operating system shell.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-2-transferring-a-balance-from-a-standard-public-account-to-a-blind-account">
<h2>Step 2: Transferring a Balance From a Standard Public Account to a Blind Account<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#step-2-transferring-a-balance-from-a-standard-public-account-to-a-blind-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve created a new, unregistered blind account named alice we can
transfer assets into it from any source, public or not. We’ll describe the steps
to transfer a balance from one blind account to another momentarily, which is
essential to fully obscure a balance from public view, but for now we’ll
illustrate a transfer from a publicly registered account to our newly created
blind account.</p>
<p>To begin, we need a wallet that has an account with assets. It can be any
account with assets, so we’ll use Peter’s Public account and transfer funds from
that into the alice account. We will also need to have the public key handy that
was printed for the alice account when it was created. Since the alice account
is not registered we need a way to refer to it before we can do the transfer. So
in this CLI session we’ll also show you how to create a label to do that and
then we’ll use that label to transfer assets into the alice blind account.</p>

</div>
<p>The above 2 steps transmit BTS assets from a public, registered account named
“peters-public-registered-account” into a single unregistered blind account
named alice using a label to refer to it named “Alice-is-Blind”.  It is
important to note that these labels are NOT persistent from one CLI session to
the next, so every time you transfer assets from a source account such as
“peters-public-registered-account” used here to a blind account you will need to
set a label to refer to the blind account.</p>
<div class="section" id="adding-a-contact">
<h3>Adding a Contact<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#adding-a-contact" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is currently no facility to transfer assets to a blind account from the
light wallet or the OpenLedger web wallet. They only support the WIF (Wallet
Import Format) and thus will not accept your blind account’s “brainkey” as a
valid private key. In the future you may be able to avoid setting labels each
time you transfer from a public to a blind account by defining a contact.
However, keep in mind that every association you establish in the path between a
public account and a confidential account may make it that much easier to trace
your steps, so think twice about the tradeoffs you make for the sake of
convenience. They just might circumvent the measures you are taking to hide
your balance. This is also true if you transfer assets directly between a
public account to a confidential account and leave them in the confidential
account. To totally obscure where your balance is held you need to transfer to
at least 2 different confidential accounts. We will cover this in a bit more
detail later. In the next step we’ll look at how to receive the transmitted
assets into alice’s blind account.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-receiving-an-asset-balance-transmitted-from-another-account">
<h2>Step 3: Receiving an Asset Balance Transmitted From Another Account<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#step-3-receiving-an-asset-balance-transmitted-from-another-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Transferring assets from one account to a confidential account involves at least
2 steps, the first to transmit the assets and the second to receive them into
the confidential account. We covered the process required to transmit assets in
Step 2, now lets see what it takes to complete the transfer and verify we have
the correct balance:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">receive_blind_transfer</span> <span class="s2">&quot;2B2vTjJ19hgqzGp8qdc8MEWmsgEUGECNJcoQTYNQqMU8bRofmbQYemXs56FoUc4Z5PdVM65nsySZgwJMq9ZSkpWQFhEqLGuZi1N3jQm8yBwaLD2DQzwY5AEW1rSK9HWJbfqNLtx8U4kc3o9xKtJoED2SgHW6jDQ7igBTcVhuUiKSwFu3DFa6LTeS5Wm5khjgy1LrR5uhmp &quot;</span><span class="n">peter</span><span class="s2">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">Peter</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="go">100 BTS  peter  =&gt;  alice   &quot;from Peter&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using the balance receipt value returned from the transfer_to_blind command in
Step 2 we can receive (i.e. import) the balance into alice’s bliind account.
Note that the source of the balance must be labeled which is the parameter that
follows the long balance receipt key. It is meant to represent to source account
from which the assets are being transferred, however it need not be. The last of
the 3 parameters is a memo text field which is an arbitrary text value. Note
that all 3 parameters are required. In the next section we will describe how to
list the confidential accounts and their balances so that we can verify our
transfer is correct and complete.</p>
<div class="section" id="listing-blind-accounts-and-their-balances">
<h3>Listing Blind Accounts and Their Balances<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#listing-blind-accounts-and-their-balances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For any wallet in which you have created confidential accounts you can list the
accounts present using the “get_my_blind_accounts” CLI command, and use the
accounts returned from that to obtain their balances:</p>

<p>To review, you have learned how to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>create a new CLI wallet and add a blind account to it</li>
<li>create a label to refer to a blind account</li>
<li>send assets from a public account to a blind account</li>
<li>receive or import assets sent from another account into a blind account</li>
<li>list the blind accounts contained in a cli wallet</li>
<li>list the asset balances of blind accounts</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These are the basic steps for a simple unidirectional transfer of a single asset
from a public account to a single blind account. Next we will examine how to
cover our trail to obscure our balance by using a second blind account and
finally we will see how to transfer from a blind account back into a public
account to wrap up our look into protecting your assets with confidential
accounts using the CLI wallet.</p>
<p>The first part was a basic demonstration of how to use the BitShares CLI wallet
to transfer an asset from a registered, public account to a confidential (i.e.
blind) account. It explained the steps involved and the current limitations of
using confidential features. Here in part 2 we will show how to transfer assets
from one confidential account to another, and conclude our look at confidential
by describing how to transfer assets from a confidential account back into a
registered public account.</p>
<p>The first part mentioned that to truly hide an account balance and eliminate any
public tractability of how the assets arrived there, at least 2 confidential
accounts should be used in the path from public source to final confidential
destination. This is due to the fact that the destination address of transfers
from a public account are visible. There may be no way for the public to query
the holdings of confidential accounts but it would not be wise to leave assets
in such an obvious hiding place either.</p>
<p>However, if those assets are moved to yet another confidential account there is
no way their whereabouts can be traced through blockchain analysis alone.
Because transfers between confidential addresses cannot be traced, even the
inference that assets remain in the first confidential address (the destination
out of the public registered account) is highly questionable. Additional layers
of confidential to confidential transfers would provide even greater security
that assets cannot be found for those with a higher sense of paranoia. It should
go without saying that disbursing assets to multiple confidential accounts is an
important security strategy for large balances. Lastly, be aware that the assets
held in confidential accounts are not counted for purposes of voting. Thus you
should consider how the use of confidential accounts will affect your
participation and influence in the policies and proposals of the BitShares
ecosystem.</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a second wallet and confidential account we will use as
our hypothetical final destination. We’ll call this account bobby. We’ve already
shown how to do this in part 1, but you may wish to review those basic steps
before you continue.</p>

<p>We need to restart the CLI wallet with the alice account, where we have a 100
BTS balance. We will create a label to refer to Bob’s confidential account
(bobby) and transfer some BTS assets from alice to bobby. Note that the process
is the same as before, and we need to set a label for the bobby (destination)
account to do the transfer.</p>

<p>There is a bit more output printed than what is shown above, but the important
results are provided. From this you can see we first set a label to refer to the
newly created “bobby” account, and the blind_transfer command fee was 15 BTS,
which sent 80 BTS of the balance (100 BTS was transferred to the alice account
in Part 1) to the bobby confidential account and provided 2 balance receipts:
the first for 5 BTS coming back to the alice account as returned change
(leftover funds), and the second which is the receipt for the 80 BTS being sent
to the bobby account, which we will need in order to receive the transfer in the
bobby account contained in the blindBobWallet file.</p>
<p>As you can see using confidential in the CLI wallet is a rather tedious “manual”
process. Do note however that you do not need to do a “receive_blind_transfer”
to import the 5 BTS change back into the alice account, at least that is taken
care of. Also important to note is as far as the outside world can see alice
sent some amount less than 100 BTS to two new outputs, one of which is the
change returned, which makes it yet that much more difficult to track what is
going on, especially since the amounts of each output are invisible.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Transferring Assets From a Confidential Account Back to a Public Account<a class="headerlink" href="confidential-transactions.html#step-5-transferring-assets-from-a-confidential-account-back-to-a-public-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this final step of our round-trip process we will transfer some of the BTS
from the bobby confidential account back to original public account named peter
we started out with. There is nothing new required to accomplish for this step,
but a couple of points are worth mentioning. First, keep in mind that the source
address for transfers coming into a public account may be visible, so consider
using one or more intermediary confidential accounts to add layers of insulation
between the public account and the resting place for your confidential assets.
Second, although you are sending to a registered, public account which one might
think needs no label to access, that isn’t the case.</p>
<p>A label must be assigned to the public destination address to return assets from
a blind (confidential) account. The public key value for the account is readily
available using the account’s permission page explorer. Use the account/key
shown under the Active Permissions heading.</p>

<p>The explanation for this CLI session is essentially the same as it was for step
4. Although the account information is different the commands used and their
role in the transfer process are the same.</p>
<p>One last example demonstrates how to split a balance between multiple
confidential accounts. This is very useful because it not only saves on transfer
fees it also obscures what amounts end up where. The point of showing this is
primarily to illustrate the syntax of the command.</p>

<p>In this case the only thing the public sees is that account ‘peter’ sent 4800
BTS to four different places. Note that although 800 and 2000 BTS were sent to
the alice confidential account they do not show up that way on the blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The outside world has no idea <em>how much</em> is in each output, only
that they all add up to 4800 BTS.</p>
